What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git created and metadata record started.  they can't guess what you need to track?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

repository is the formal record.  working directory is the garage.  staging area is the lobby?  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	keep an eye out on logically connected files in the staging area?  only work on one thing at a time? 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	when creating functional subvariants of the app, or when trying to experiment without touching the "important version"

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	... eh?  pictures easer than text?  

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	you now have a unified branch.  it joins back in?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	saves time and effort vs absolute certainty (though not really since weariness causes errors also)
