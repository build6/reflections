How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    highlights the differences so you don't need to see the similarities

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    can work out the reasoning process?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    you're more able to know when a change is significant vs "automatic" systems

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    document-centric workloads?  designed for coding vs not designed for coding

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - all commits listed, use vi controls to search.  git diff - remember is git diff oldver newver.  also this section or maybe 1-2 before has config colour command

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    easier to roll back the changes so if it breaks why not

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    develop apps
